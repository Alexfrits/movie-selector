#Movie Selector App
----

This app was born from a reflexion that we all faced one day:
*What movie will we watch today?*

I thought, well, there must be, somewhere on the Internet, a movie database, that allows me to randomly find a movie to watch tonight.
I found the free [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/) really easy to use, and great to start with.

The real goal of project was to use the fetch API, and getting used to the Promise object in JavaScript.
